    **Example Requests**

        GET /api/completion/v1/course/
        GET /api/completion/v1/course/?requested_fields=chapter,vertical

    **Response Values**

        The response is a dictionary comprising pagination data and a page
        of results.

        * page: The page number of the current set of results.
        * next: The URL for the next page of results, or None if already on
          the last page.
        * previous: The URL for the previous page of results, or None if
          already on the first page.
        * count: The total number of available results.
        * results: A list of dictionaries representing the user's completion
          for each course.

        Standard fields for each completion dictionary:

        * course_key (CourseKey): The unique course identifier.
        * completion: A dictionary comprising of the following fields:
            * earned (float): The sum of the learner's completions.
            * possible (float): The total number of completions available
              in the course.
            * ratio (float in the range [0.0, 1.0]): The ratio of earned
              completions to possible completions in the course.

        Optional fields, as requested in "requested_fields":

        * mean (float): The average completion ratio for all students enrolled
          in the course.
        * Aggregators: The actual fields available are configurable, but
          may include `chapter`, `sequential`, or `vertical`.  If requested,
          the field will be a list of all blocks of that type containing
          completion information for that block.  Fields for each entry will
          include:

              * course_key (CourseKey): The unique course identifier.
              * usage_key: (UsageKey) The unique block identifier.
              * completion: A completion dictionary, identical in format to
                the course-level completion dictionary.

    **Parameters**

        username (optional):
            The username of the specified user for whom the course data is
            being accessed.  If not specified, this defaults to the requesting
            user.

        requested_fields (optional):
            A comma separated list of extra data to be returned.  This can be
            one of the block types specified in `AGGREGATE_CATEGORIES`, or any of
            the other optional fields specified above.  If any invalid fields
            are requested, a 400 error will be returned.

    **Returns**

        * 200 on success with above fields
        * 400 if an invalid value was sent for requested_fields.
        * 403 if a user who does not have permission to masquerade as another
          user specifies a username other than their own.
        * 404 if the course is not available or the requesting user can see no
          completable sections.
